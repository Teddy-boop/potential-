      <p>ALKANES are hydrocarbons containing hydrogen and oxygen with carbon-carbon single bond</p>
    <p>They are also called paraffins.They are gasses we can find and use in our homes,offices,industrys,schools and hostipal laboratorys etc.The first gas in (METHANE) this family is very reactive.It has the molecular formula of CH4.</p>
    <p>Alkanes have the general molecular formula of CnH2n+2</p>
    <P>The gas we use in our homes is called Butane which is the fourth member in the alkane family it has the molecular formula of C4H10.Its used in our homes because it can be compressed for a very long period of time without exploding.</P>
   <p>Characteristics of Gases inlude;</p>
   <ul>
       <li>They have fixed shape</li>
       <li>They have no fixed volume</li>
       <li>They are compressible</li>
       <li>They are less dense</li>
       <li>The gas particles are loosely packed together</li>
       <li>They move freeling in the container colliding with each other and with the walls of the container exerting pressures</li>
   </ul>
